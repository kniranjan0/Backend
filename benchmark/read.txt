The sun shone brightly over the meadow as Class 1
of Sunny Meadows Woodland School
set off for their first trip to the Shadow Woods.
Everyone was excited to be going on the adventure
that they had been talking about for weeks. Their
teacher, Miss Squirrel, had promised a trip to
remember and the whole class now skipped excitedly
through the meadow. Well, nearly all of the class;
alone at the back of the group waddled Hank. Hank
was a hedgehog who found it difficult to make
friends. He always felt like the outsider. The others in
the class, especially Matilda Mouse, kept away from
Hank because they thought him odd.
Yes, Hank was not really looking forward to the day.
The journey to the Shadow Woods was longer than
expected because Mr. Mole’s tunnel train was
broken. Indeed Mr. Mole was there waving them
off before he got back to work. This just made
Miss Squirrel happier though, as she could talk to
the children about all the wonderful flowers that
filled Sunny Meadow. There was color everywhere.
It looked as if a rainbow had crashed into the field.
However, at the edge of the meadow, not everyone
was looking at the flowers…
Soon though, the Shadow Woods were upon them
and something that looked small from far away
suddenly grew very large before them. Each member
of the class gave a slow gulp-Matilda Mouse,
Rachel Rabbit, Wendy Weasel and Ralph Racoon.
The biggest gulp came from Hank. He was nervous
enough before they got to the woods and didn’t
have a friend to hold on to. Matilda pretended to
be brave, however, and ran on ahead compelling her
friends to join her.
Miss Squirrel was not happy about that and so she
shouted for Matilda to come back. Then off she
chased after her. Soon the whole class followed and
before they knew it, they were right in the middle
of the woods. Now instead of bright sunshine, only
shadows scattered before them.
The class stopped, their little mouths open in awe
and wonder. Miss Squirrel was still chasing Matilda
though and did not notice that she had left the little
ones behind. Rachel Rabbit, Wendy Weasel and Ralph
Racoon all held paws as they looked around them.
Three very small friends.And Hank.The only noise
now in the woods was silence.
Suddenly, everyone got a fright as behind them
Matilda mouse jumped from behind a berry-bush and
shouted “BOO!” as loudly as she could. After they all
had stopped shaking, her friends laughed.All except
Hank. “Silly Hank,” said Matilda.
“You are just no fun!”
However, before Hank could reply, another noise
made everyone turn around. This time though there
was no Boo! of surprise and no laughter afterwards
because there before the class was a very large
and very hungry snake. His magical eyes twinkling
with delight as his tongue spiked forward. “Mmmm!!
Lunchtime.” said the snake.
It was at this point that the class realised that Miss
Squirrel had not returned from chasing Matilda. The
class was alone. Squeaks of fright squeezed out of
the little animals’ mouths. Matilda and her friends all
hugged each other fearing that this was the end.
Suddenly though, Hank was scared no more. He
found a way to save the class. He knew just what
he had to do. “Quick everyone- down this hole.” he
shouted as he pointed to a hole under a hanging
chestnut Tree. The animals stared at him and then
jumped down the hole. Hank followed only to be
stopped by Matilda who looked very angry.
“Hank, we are trapped now- you foolish hog.” But
before she could add to her insult, Hank jumped
up and flipped himself into a ball. Next, he rolled
towards the mouth of the hole and blocked it with
his pointy sharp spikes. There would be no lunch for
the snake today!
Later, back at school, Miss Squirrel was telling the
head teacher, Mr Owl, about what had happened
and how the snake had fled Hank’s pointy spikes.
After the snake had slithered away, the class had
quickly returned to school and each one had thanked
their new friend Hank.
Matilda gave him a big hug and apologised for what
she had called him before. Hank was not odd, he was
a hero and her new best friend. Hank, who was still
unused to lots of attention, turned pink and popped
into a ball as all his new friends
cheered him.
